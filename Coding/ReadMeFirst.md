Question 1.

Write a middleware that validates an attribute named "api-key" (see line 11 in main.go) in request Header for test.Test1 (see line 16 in main.go).



Question 2.

Complete test.Test1 (see line 16 in main.go). This api request handler takes an array named "Array" from data in request Body. Convert this array to a linked list. In each node, a property of interface{} type is used to store the value.

Example
input:
{
"Array": ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
}

output:
head -> a
node1 -> b
node2 -> c
node3 -> d
tail -> e
